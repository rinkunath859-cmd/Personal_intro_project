Through this project, I learned how to build a simple interactive Python program using fundamental programming concepts. I practiced collecting user input using the input() function and storing the responses in variables. I also learned how to use formatted strings (f-strings) to create dynamic and personalized output messages.

I understood how to structure a basic Python project professionally by organising files such as the main script (personal_intro.py), README.md, requirements.txt, and a screenshot of the program output. This helped me understand the importance of proper documentation and clear project presentation.

Additionally, I learned how to write clean and readable code with comments for better understanding. I gained confidence in running Python programs using the terminal and preparing projects for GitHub submission.

Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of Python basics, improved my coding structure, and introduced me to professional project documentation practices.
