# Personal Introduction Python Program

## 📌 Project Description
This is a beginner-friendly Python program that collects user information such as name, age, hobby, favourite food, and dream job.  
It then displays a personalised and welcoming message.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install Python
2. Open a terminal in the project folder
3. Run:

 1. Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a beginner-level Python program that collects user information and generates a personalized welcome message. The goal is to practice fundamental Python concepts such as user input handling, variable storage, and formatted output while maintaining clean code structure and proper documentation.

2. Setup Instructions

Install Python 3 from the official website.

Download or clone the project folder.

Open the terminal in the project directory.

Run the program using:
python personal_intro.py
No external libraries are required for this project.

3. Code Structure

The project is organized into separate files for clarity:

personal_intro.py – Main Python script

README.md – Project documentation

requirements.txt – Dependency file

screenshot.png – Output evidence

The code is structured with clear variable names, comments, and logical flow.

4. Visual Documentation

A screenshot of the program execution is included to demonstrate successful functionality and correct output display.

5. Technical Details

The program uses basic Python constructs including variables, string formatting (f-strings), and built-in input/output functions. No external data structures or libraries are required.

6. Testing Evidence

The program was tested by running multiple inputs for different users. Each test confirmed that the personalized message correctly displays the entered data.  
Through this project, I learned how to build a simple interactive Python program using fundamental programming concepts. I practiced collecting user input using the input() function and storing the responses in variables. I also learned how to use formatted strings (f-strings) to create dynamic and personalized output messages.

I understood how to structure a basic Python project professionally by organising files such as the main script (personal_intro.py), README.md, requirements.txt, and a screenshot of the program output. This helped me understand the importance of proper documentation and clear project presentation.

Additionally, I learned how to write clean and readable code with comments for better understanding. I gained confidence in running Python programs using the terminal and preparing projects for GitHub submission.

Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of Python basics, improved my coding structure, and introduced me to professional project documentation practices.
